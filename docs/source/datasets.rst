Dataset and pretrained models
=========
We provide two dataset collections: OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz and OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz.

If you want to use your own training data, please use OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz. OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz includes the minial files (ontology files) needed to run OnClass on your own dataset. You need to provide the annotated cells (training data) and then OnClass can classify unannotated cells.

If you don't have your own training data, plese use OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz. OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz includes training data (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis, Lemur, HLCA, Allen brian), pretrained models, intermediate files (they can be generated by our script), and ontology files in OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz. You can use OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz to classify unannotated cells.

These two collections can be found at `figshare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/OnClass_cell_ontology/14256530>`__.

The files in OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz are:

OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz is the Ontology_data folder.

1) scRNA_data
~~~~~~~~~

Download three parts from `link 1 <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/OnClass_data_public_scRNA_data_tar_gz_0/14776368>`__, `link 2 <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/OnClass_data_public_scRNA_data_tar_gz_1/14776380>`__, `link 3 <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/OnClass_data_public_scRNA_data_tar_gz_2/14776383>`__. Jointly extract the files using

.. code:: bash

	cat OnClass_data_public_scRNA_data.tar.gz.* | tar -xz

..

	This will give you all the single cell gene expression data used in our paper (see Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs. 1-3, Supplementary Figs. 4-7).


2) Ontology_data
~~~~~~~~~

This include Cell Ontology and Allen brain Ontology. Cell Ontology has cell type text definition. cl.ontology.nlp.emb is the text embedding of the definition of each cell type.


3) Pretrained_model
~~~~~~~~~

8 tensorflow pretrained models trained from 8 dataset in Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs. 1-3, Supplementary Figs. 4-7.


4) Intermediate_files
~~~~~~~~~

Intermediate files for some scripts in cross dataset prediction and marker genes identification. This can help reproduce results in our paper.
