Dataset and pretrained models
=========
We provide two dataset collections: OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz and OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz.

If you want to use your own training data, please use OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz. OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz includes the minial files (ontology files) needed to run OnClass on your own dataset. You need to provide the annotated cells (training data) and then OnClass can classify unannotated cells.

If you don't have your own training data, plese use OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz. OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz includes training data (e.g., Tabula Muris Senis, Lemur, HLCA, Allen brian), pretrained models, intermediate files (they can be generated by our script), and ontology files in OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz. You can use OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz to classify unannotated cells.

These two collections can be found at `figshare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/OnClass_cell_ontology/14256530>`__.

The files in OnClass_data_public_all.tar.gz are:

OnClass_data_public_minimal.tar.gz is the Ontology_data folder.


Currently, we include:

1) 26-datasets
~~~~~~~~~

26-datasets obtained from Scanorama project.


2) cell_ontology
~~~~~~~~~

The Cell Ontology file used in our analysis, which is downloaded from `OBO Foundry <http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html>`__.


3) figures
~~~~~~~~~

Reproduced figures in the paper using OnClass.


4) marker_genes
~~~~~~~~~

Marker genes for 2331 cell types identified by OnClass and curated by experts

5) pretrained model
~~~~~~~~~

cell type embedding and pretrain prediction model

6) raw data
~~~~~~~~~

Gene expression data for FACS cells and droplet cells used in our analysis.
