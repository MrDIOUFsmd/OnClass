Introduction
=========
OnClass is a python package for single-cell cell type annotation. It uses the Cell Ontology to capture the cell type similarity. These similarities enable OnClass to annotate cell types that are never seen in the training data.

OnClass package is still under development. A preprint of OnClass paper is on `bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/810234v1>`__
All datasets used in OnClass can be found in `czbiohub <https://figshare.com/projects/OnClass/70637>`__.  
Currently, OnClass supports 

1) annotate cell type

2) integrating different single-cell datasets based on the Cell Ontology

3) marker genes identification

Here is the flowchart of OnClass

OnClass is a joint work by `Altman lab <https://helix.stanford.edu/>`__ at stanford and `czbiohub <https://www.czbiohub.org/>`__.
